# A burning desire

Once there was a little girl who wanted to **fly** :fairy_woman:. Every night she prayed :pray: she would wake up with wings. On her 11th birtday *something strange* happened :eyes:.

The little girl could finally fly ...15 years later! But sadly not with wings. She got a book about "how to become a pilot" so she had a new goal in life. She studied everyday until she finally become a world class pilot and see the whole world. But thats not all!

People were calling her crazy girl, while her family supported her throughout the journey. When she left for round-the-world adventure, media called her, "Supergirl". She saw the remarkable beauty of nature which she describes, beauty as far as the eye can see.

Her stories of new land, people and animals would leave anyone listening stunned. The magical places she described with the same passion as her piloting, would bring sceneries of beauty and terror to anyone listening. Her contributions to science, economy and history where more than any other single person in the world. Her favorite part from everything, parties, ceremonies, meetings, was surrounding herself with children to speak to them about her adventures, and see the joy in their eyes, as they fly with her with every adventure, once again, reviving her childhood dream, to be able to fly.
