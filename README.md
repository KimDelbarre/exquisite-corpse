<h1>A burning desire</h1>
<p>Once there was a little girl who wanted to **fly** :fairy_woman:. Every night she prayed :pray: she would wake up with wings. On her 11th birtday *something strange* happened :eyes:.</p>

The little girl could finally fly ...15 years later! But sadly not with wings. She got a book about "how to become a pilot" so she had a new goal in life. She studied everyday until she finally become a world class pilot and see the whole world. But thats not all!

People were calling her crazy girl, while her family supported her throughout the journey. When she left for round-the-world adventure, media called her, "Supergirl". She saw the remarkable beauty of nature which she describes, beauty as far as the eye can see.
